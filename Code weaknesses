Weakness number 1:
The name of the method didPlayerWin() is very misleading, since it returns true if the player has not won yet, even though the name
suggests it should return false in that case.  Vice versa for when the player has won.  Also, if there is a question that is worth two gold
purses, the "==" condition could cause future bugs, since the counter could go past 6.

Weakness number 2:
When all questions are exhausted, there is no definition of what will happen, which will most definitely cause bugs in all game implementations
if left as is.

Weakness number 3:
Changing the condition of game termination can make the wasCorrectlyAnswered() method create bugs, since it simply returns a "true"
value for all cases for some conditions.

Weakness number 4:
askQuestion() method uses "==" operator to evaluate strings, which, since they are objects, compares the references of both variables.
This can cause a lot of bugs in the future.

Weakness number 5:
wrongAnswer() can be incorporated into wasCorrectlyAnswered() by simply defining a condition and when it is false, would do what the
wrongAnswer() method does.  This is a general design flaw, however, also with the GameRunner.java class, because this method is
required to simulate the game in the way that is given.
